# RaceClick
My first Original 2D game that I fully programmed and designed
Core gameplay scripts are in the raceSet.cs and explodeOnClick.cs
The game was made by using free assets and scripts on the internet
I took approximately 3 month to finish it while working on my Game FQA tester job at the time
Made it happend with lots of googling, tutorials and dedication/passion
